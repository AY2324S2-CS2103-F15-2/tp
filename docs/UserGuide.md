## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103-F15-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar <version_no>.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 s/English at/present pa/paid d/2024-02-03 1800` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `view`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* `GRADE` parameter input (i.e. `g/GRADE`) follows the NUS grading system. (i.e. [A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D+, D, F])

* `GRADE` and `SUBJECT` are currently both independent fields, i.e. `GRADE` can be assigned despite not having a `SUBJECT`.

* At most 1 `GRADE` and 1 `SUBJECT` can be assigned per student.

* You can view a student's note by clicking on the Note button beside the student. The note can be edited using the `edit` command (refer to usage below for more information).

* `PAYMENT` should either be `Paid` or `Not Paid` with case-insensitive input. (i.e., `paid` or `PAID` are valid inputs)

* `ATTENDANCE` should either be `Present` or `Absent` with case-insensitive input. (i.e., `present` or `PRESENT`are valid inputs)

* `DateTime` parameter should be in yyyy-mm-dd hhmm and a valid date i.e. `2024-03-02 1800`

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Command history : `history`

There are two differing behaviours for this function.
* Lists down the last 10 successful commands in an independent command history list.
* Re-run commands based on the specified index.

Enter [list](#listing-all-students--list) to return back to the student list.

Format syntax and more information below.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
Commands that are saved are not persistent. (i.e. The commands that are saved in one instance will be lost after closing the app.)
</div>

Format: `history [INDEX]`

* Upon entering `history` (i.e. leaving whitespace / not entering any index):
  * it will show a command history list, featuring a new, independent list showing previous successful commands.
  * The command history list also ignores saving `history` command itself.
  * Lists at most 10 successful commands.

* Upon entering `history [INDEX]`:
  * It will re-run the command that was specified by the index.
  * The index here refers to the index number shown in the command history list.
  * The index **must be a positive integer**, and should be within the list's boundaries.
  * The output message is determined by the re-run command. (i.e. `history [INDEX]` itself does not have any success message.)

Examples:

* `history` returns a command history list.
![history](images/commandHistory.png)

* Upon running `history 1` from the result above, it runs the `list` command and returns the student list. It also outputs the success message of `list`.
![history 1](images/commandHistory1.png)



### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
